# My-Portfolio-Website
My portfolio website is my first project on GitHub, built entirely with HTML and CSS. The idea behind this project was to create a unique and original resume for the future.

The website consists of several sections that highlight my skills, experience, and projects. 
The design is minimalist and clean, making it easy for the user to navigate and find the information they need.

One of the main challenges I faced while building this website was making sure it was responsive across all devices. I spent a lot of time testing and tweaking the layout to ensure that it looked great on desktop, tablet, and mobile.

In addition to showcasing my skills and experience, I also included a portfolio section where I can showcase my previous work. This section includes links to some of my best projects, giving potential employers a better understanding of my capabilities (TO DO).

Overall, I'm really happy with how my portfolio website turned out. It was a great learning experience, and I gained a lot of valuable skills in HTML and CSS. I look forward to adding more projects and updates to the website in the future as I continue to grow and develop as a developer.
